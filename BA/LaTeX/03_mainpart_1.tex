\chapter{This is the first main part of the work}
\label{c:mainpart1}

This chapter will first outline the problems that constitutes the main portion of this work. Each problem is described separately starting with the available data sources followed by a detailed description of the proposed solutions. After that, the proposed solutions are evaluated by empirical means and the results are presented. Performance studies are conducted to provide suitable recommendations concerning the real world application.



\section{Problem Descriptions}
\label{s:prob_describtion}

There are two main problems researched in this Bachelor/Master Thesis.

As stated in the previous chapter~\ref{c:preliminaries}...

\textbf{''Question 1''}. 

When ... the second question arises: 

\textbf{''Question 2''}

This question will mainly be answered with the help of empirical data gathered from...
